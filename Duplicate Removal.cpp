 Problem description
 The company Al's Chocolate Mangos has a web site where visitors can guess how many chocolate covered mangos are in a virtual jar. Visitors type in a guess between 1 and 99 and then click on a "Submit" button. Unfortunately, the response time from the server is often long, and visitors get impatient and click "Submit" several times in a row. This generates many duplicate requests.
 
 Your task is to write a program to assist the staff at ACM in filtering out these duplicate requests.
 
 
 
 Input
 The input consists of a series of lines, one for each web session. The first integer on a line is N, 0 < N â‰¤ 25, which is the number of guesses on this line. These guesses are all between 1 and 99, inclusive. The value N = 0 indicates the end of all the input. 
 
 Output
 For each input data set, output a single line with the guesses in the original order, but with consecutive duplicates removed. Conclude each output line with the dollar sign character '$'. Note that there is a single space between the last integer and the dollar sign.
 
 Sample Input
 5 1 22 22 22 3
 4 98 76 20 76
 6 19 19 35 86 86 86
 1 7
 0
 Sample Output
 1 22 3 $
 98 76 20 76 $
 19 35 86 $
 7 $
