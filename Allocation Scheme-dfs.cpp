 Problem description
 A manager of one company received a emergent project that needs to be completed in shortest timeã€‚With considering and analysing, the manager would divide the project into N independent tasks and that needs N employees to complete. Every ernployee can do any one of the N tasks, but the time is different. Please design a allocation scheme for the manager to make the task can be completed in shortest time. 
 
 Input
 The number of the employees N begins with 0, so is the tasks number N. The time of every task done by every employee is stored in a two-dimensional array task_worker[N][N]. For example: task_worker[i][j] means the time of task i completed by employee j.
 
 Output
 The first row show the shortest time to complete the project.(unit: hour)
 Output the situation of the allocation scheme. 
 
 Sample Input
 10  11  12  11  9  11
 11  9   10  13  11  12
 12  10  11  10  13  9
 9   14  9   10  10  11
 10  10  9   11  12  11
 10  7  10   10  10   8
 Sample Output
 The shortest time is 54 hours
 Task 0 is distributed to employee 4
 Task 1 is distributed to employee 1
 Task 2 is distributed to employee 3
 Task 3 is distributed to employee 0
 Task 4 is distributed to employee 2
 Task 5 is distributed to employee 5
