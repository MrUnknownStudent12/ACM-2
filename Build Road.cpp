 Problem description
 There are n cities on the map, you are asked to bulid roads that satisfy this condition: For each pair of different cities of A and B, there is only one way between A and B when each road can be visited at most once. Then how many methods can you adopt?
 
 Input
 The first line contains the number of test cases T, then the following T lines each contains an integer number n (2 <= n <= 17)ï¼Œ represent the number of cities in the map.
 
 Output
 For each test case, print the number of methods to build the roads that satisfy the conditions.
