/*
 Problem description
 Your task is to write a program to raise an integer matrix to a given power using modulo arithmetic.There is no back story here; at least not one that can be told. The application is too confidential(spying and military intelligence and all that) to be described in public. For example, to raise the 2 by 2 matrix 
 
 to the power 2 using modulo 17 arithmetic 
 
 
 
 Input
 The input consists of a number of problems. Each problem starts with a line holding three numbers (N, M, and P) separated by single spaces. 1 <= N <= 100 is the size (N by N) of the matrix to be processed. 2 <= M <= 32000 is the modulo base and 1 <= P <= 32000 is the power to which the matrix must be raised. Following this line are N lines, each holding the n integer values of successive rows of the matrix as a series of positive integers i: 0 <= i < M separated by single spaces. Input is terminated by a line with three zeros.
 
 Output
 Output for each problem consists of a blank line, followed by the N rows of the result matrix. Each row is output on a single line as a sequence of integer values separated by single spaces. It doesnÂ´t matter that lines may be quite long-no-one will be allowed to read them anyway.
